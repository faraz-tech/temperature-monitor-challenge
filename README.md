## Architecture Overview

The architecture of the temperature processing system is designed to efficiently handle the flow of temperature data from the backend to the frontend, using **n8n workflows** for processing. Below is an outline of the key components and data flow.

## System Components

1. **Backend (Temperature Generation)**  
   The backend is responsible for generating the raw temperature data. This data is then sent to two destinations:
   - **MongoDB**: The raw temperature data is stored in a MongoDB database for persistent storage.
   - **n8n**: The same temperature data is sent as a raw event to the **n8n webhook** for further processing.

2. **n8n Workflow**  
   n8n is used to process the temperature data. Upon receiving the webhook request from the backend:
   - The temperature data is evaluated using conditional logic (If/Else conditions).
   - Based on the temperature value:
     - If the temperature is greater than 25¬∞C, a response indicating "High Temperature" is generated.
     - If the temperature is less than or equal to 25¬∞C, a response indicating "Low Temperature" is generated.

3. **MongoDB**  
   Once n8n processes the temperature data and generates the appropriate response, the workflow updates the temperature information in **MongoDB**. The database is updated with the processed temperature and status (e.g., high or low temperature).

4. **Frontend**  
   After the data is updated in MongoDB, it is then sent to the **frontend** for display to the user. The frontend displays the current temperature status (high or low) based on the data retrieved from the database.

## Data Flow

1. **Temperature Generation**: The backend generates raw temperature data.
2. **Storing in MongoDB**: The backend stores the raw temperature data in MongoDB.
3. **Sending to n8n**: The backend sends the raw temperature data to n8n via a webhook.
4. **Processing in n8n**: n8n evaluates the temperature using If/Else conditions and generates a response (high or low).
5. **Updating MongoDB**: The response (high/low temperature) is stored back into MongoDB.
6. **Displaying to Frontend**: The frontend retrieves the processed data from MongoDB and displays it to the user.

## Processing Approach Options

### Preferred Approach: n8n Workflow Integration

#### Overview
The preferred approach for temperature processing is utilizing **n8n Workflow Integration**. This method demonstrates the ability to work with workflow automation tools and showcases an understanding of service integration.

#### Workflow Implementation using n8n

1. **Setup n8n Locally**  
   To begin, I set up a local environment for **n8n** using a Docker image. This allows for quick access to n8n on my local machine for testing and development.

   ```bash
   docker run --rm -d -p 5678:5678 n8nio/n8n
   ```

   After setting up and running the Docker container, I accessed the n8n interface by navigating to http://localhost:5678.

2. **Sign Up and Login**  
Upon accessing n8n for the first time, I signed up and logged in to my n8n account to start building workflows.

3. **Create New Workflow**  
After logging in, I created a new workflow by selecting the Create New Workflow button in the n8n dashboard.

4. **Webhook Setup**  
In the new workflow, I used the Webhook option to accept requests from the backend server. This allows for the temperature data to be received and processed within the workflow.

5. **Processing Temperature Data with Conditional Logic**  
After receiving the request, I used If/Else condition cards to evaluate the temperature. The workflow checks if the temperature is greater than 25¬∞C.

- If the temperature is greater than 25¬∞C, the workflow will respond with a "High Temperature" response.
- If the temperature is 25¬∞C or lower, the workflow will respond with a "Low Temperature" response.

6. **Event Handling for Responses**  
Based on the conditions, I used the Events option to set up two distinct webhook responses:

- One for a "high temperature" response
- One for a "low temperature" response  
These events allow the system to send the appropriate response body based on the evaluated condition.
