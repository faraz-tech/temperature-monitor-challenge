5. **Manual Workflow Import and Activation in n8n, if get any issue**

    If the workflow is not visible after starting the n8n Docker container, follow these steps to manually import and activate the workflow:

    #### Steps to Import and Activate the Workflow

    a. **Start n8n Docker Container**    
   First, ensure that the **n8n Docker container** is running. You can start it by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   docker run --rm -d -p 5678:5678 n8nio/n8n
    ```

    b. **Access the n8n Web Interface**  
    Open the n8n UI in your browser (http://localhost:5678) and log in with your credentials.

    c. **Check for Existing Workflow**
    If the desired workflow is not showing, it may need to be manually imported from the workflows folder in n8n.

    d. **Find Workflow File in n8n**  
    - The workflows can be found in the workflows directory inside the n8n Docker container or in your local n8n directory. The workflow is typically stored as a .json file.
    - Locate the workflow file you want to import, usually located at:

    ```bash
    n8n/workflows/
    ```

    e. **Manually Import the Workflow**  
    If the workflow is missing from the n8n interface, you can manually import the workflow file.

    f. **Navigate to the n8n UI.**  
    - Click on the "Import" button in the top-right corner of the workflow editor.  
    - Choose the .json workflow file from the workflows folder and import it into n8n.
    - Activate the Workflow
    - Once the workflow is successfully imported, open it, and click the Activate button at the top of the workflow editor to enable the workflow.

    g. **Get the Production URL**  
    After activating the workflow, you will need to get the production URL (or webhook URL) for the workflow. This URL is used to make requests from the backend to the n8n webhook.

    - You can find this URL in the Webhook node configuration within the workflow.
    - Copy the Webhook URL to use in your backend.
    - Update Backend Environment
    - In the backend application, update the environment variables to include the newly obtained production URL. This will ensure that the backend sends requests to the correct n8n webhook endpoint.

    Example:
    ```
    N8N_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-n8n-webhook-url.com
    ```

## Architecture Overview

The architecture of the temperature processing system is designed to efficiently handle the flow of temperature data from the backend to the frontend, using **n8n workflows** for processing. Below is an outline of the key components and data flow.

## System Components

1. **Backend (Temperature Generation)**  
   The backend is responsible for generating the raw temperature data. This data is then sent to two destinations:
   - **MongoDB**: The raw temperature data is stored in a MongoDB database for persistent storage.
   - **n8n**: The same temperature data is sent as a raw event to the **n8n webhook** for further processing.

2. **n8n Workflow**  
   n8n is used to process the temperature data. Upon receiving the webhook request from the backend:
   - The temperature data is evaluated using conditional logic (If/Else conditions).
   - Based on the temperature value:
     - If the temperature is greater than 25¬∞C, a response indicating "High Temperature" is generated.
     - If the temperature is less than or equal to 25¬∞C, a response indicating "Low Temperature" is generated.

3. **MongoDB**  
   Once n8n processes the temperature data and generates the appropriate response, the workflow updates the temperature information in **MongoDB**. The database is updated with the processed temperature and status (e.g., high or low temperature).

4. **Frontend**  
   After the data is updated in MongoDB, it is then sent to the **frontend** for display to the user. The frontend displays the current temperature status (high or low) based on the data retrieved from the database.

## Data Flow

1. **Temperature Generation**: The backend generates raw temperature data.
2. **Storing in MongoDB**: The backend stores the raw temperature data in MongoDB.
3. **Sending to n8n**: The backend sends the raw temperature data to n8n via a webhook.
4. **Processing in n8n**: n8n evaluates the temperature using If/Else conditions and generates a response (high or low).
5. **Updating MongoDB**: The response (high/low temperature) is stored back into MongoDB.
6. **Displaying to Frontend**: The frontend retrieves the processed data from MongoDB and displays it to the user.

## Processing Approach Options

### Preferred Approach: n8n Workflow Integration

#### Overview
The preferred approach for temperature processing is utilizing **n8n Workflow Integration**. This method demonstrates the ability to work with workflow automation tools and showcases an understanding of service integration.

#### Workflow Implementation using n8n

1. **Setup n8n Locally**  
   To begin, I set up a local environment for **n8n** using a Docker image. This allows for quick access to n8n on my local machine for testing and development.

   ```bash
   docker run --rm -d -p 5678:5678 n8nio/n8n
   ```

   After setting up and running the Docker container, I accessed the n8n interface by navigating to http://localhost:5678.

2. **Sign Up and Login**  
Upon accessing n8n for the first time, I signed up and logged in to my n8n account to start building workflows.

3. **Create New Workflow**  
After logging in, I created a new workflow by selecting the Create New Workflow button in the n8n dashboard.

4. **Webhook Setup**  
In the new workflow, I used the Webhook option to accept requests from the backend server. This allows for the temperature data to be received and processed within the workflow.

5. **Processing Temperature Data with Conditional Logic**  
After receiving the request, I used If/Else condition cards to evaluate the temperature. The workflow checks if the temperature is greater than 25¬∞C.

- If the temperature is greater than 25¬∞C, the workflow will respond with a "High Temperature" response.
- If the temperature is 25¬∞C or lower, the workflow will respond with a "Low Temperature" response.

6. **Event Handling for Responses**  
Based on the conditions, I used the Events option to set up two distinct webhook responses:

- One for a "high temperature" response
- One for a "low temperature" response  
These events allow the system to send the appropriate response body based on the evaluated condition.
