        }
    ]

## Architecture Overview


## Processing Approach Options

### Preferred Approach: n8n Workflow Integration

#### Overview
The preferred approach for temperature processing is utilizing **n8n Workflow Integration**. This method demonstrates the ability to work with workflow automation tools and showcases an understanding of service integration.

#### Workflow Implementation using n8n

1. **Setup n8n Locally**  
   To begin, I set up a local environment for **n8n** using a Docker image. This allows for quick access to n8n on my local machine for testing and development.

   ```bash
   docker run --rm -d -p 5678:5678 n8nio/n8n
   ```

   After setting up and running the Docker container, I accessed the n8n interface by navigating to http://localhost:5678.

2. **Sign Up and Login**  
Upon accessing n8n for the first time, I signed up and logged in to my n8n account to start building workflows.

3. **Create New Workflow**  
After logging in, I created a new workflow by selecting the Create New Workflow button in the n8n dashboard.

4. **Webhook Setup**  
In the new workflow, I used the Webhook option to accept requests from the backend server. This allows for the temperature data to be received and processed within the workflow.

5. **Processing Temperature Data with Conditional Logic**  
After receiving the request, I used If/Else condition cards to evaluate the temperature. The workflow checks if the temperature is greater than 25¬∞C.

- If the temperature is greater than 25¬∞C, the workflow will respond with a "High Temperature" response.
- If the temperature is 25¬∞C or lower, the workflow will respond with a "Low Temperature" response.

6. **Event Handling for Responses**  
Based on the conditions, I used the Events option to set up two distinct webhook responses:

- One for a "high temperature" response
- One for a "low temperature" response  
These events allow the system to send the appropriate response body based on the evaluated condition.
